                          <h2>Taiwan Taipei Mission</h2>
                          <p>As a missionary, we also had the opportunity to learn a new language and immerse ourselves in a different culture. We worked with local members of the community to build relationships and offer service in any way we could. This included things like teaching English classes, helping with community service projects, and simply being a listening ear for those who needed it.</p>
                          <p>Throughout our time in Taiwan, we faced various challenges, but we learned to persevere and find joy in the journey. We also learned valuable life skills like effective communication, problem-solving, and time management. These experiences have had a lasting impact on our lives and continue to shape who we are today.</p>
                          <p>In addition to serving as a missionary, we also had the opportunity to attend various leadership trainings and conferences. This helped us develop leadership skills that we were able to apply not only in our missionary work but also in our personal and professional lives.</p>
                          <p>Overall, serving as a missionary was a life-changing experience that taught us the value of hard work, dedication, and service to others. It was a humbling and rewarding experience that we will never forget.</p>

                            <h2>Taiwan Taipei Mission</h2>
                            <p>As Vice President of BYUH, I had the privilege of leading and serving a team of around 80 members in our club. Our primary goal was to help club members build strong relationships with one another, and to achieve this, we organized a range of activities throughout the semester, such as career workshops, sports events, and cultural nights.</p>
                            <p>In this role, I developed strong leadership skills, including the ability to effectively communicate with team members and delegate tasks to ensure that our events were executed smoothly. I also learned how to prioritize tasks and manage my time effectively, ensuring that I was always available to assist team members whenever necessary.</p>
                            <p>Overall, my experience as Vice President of BYUH taught me the importance of strong leadership skills and the ability to work collaboratively with others to achieve common goals. I am confident that these skills will serve me well in my future endeavors, both personally and professionally.</p>
